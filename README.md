# calculator twitch challenge / code review


I've been learning how to program for the past month now.

At first I was going to write several functions for each operation until I read about Classes and how they are reusable. So I tried to use Classes instead.

This one class took me about 3-4 hours to write lol. An important thing I learned AND implemented today was you can have a function within a class. My biggest obstacle for the day was actually getting the sum function to work and overall syntax related errors. I know what I want the computer to do but I just don't know the words to type but even though its frustrating i'm learning how to read documents better and its fun. I met someone on twitch named Zomglings he said he learned python from just docs!


Anyways as of right now the program can take two integars and add them together all within the same class named Addition.

In addition (no pun intended), I practiced some git commands such as commiting, git add <fileName> .
(apparently its bad practice to use plain old git add .)


My current worry right now is how to make an interface and how to make it interact with my backend.

Out of my 3 weeks of coding, I spent the first two weeks learning html and setting up my enviorment.


Any tips zomglings? or any one else out there! 
  also i forgot i made a github in highschool so thats why it shows 2 contributors
